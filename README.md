# Initial setup

## Note
You may want to switch 'python3' in the following terminal commands to 'python' depending on how you have it installed.

To make sure you have python installed, run this command in your terminal:
```
python3 --version
```

If you don't have it installed, you can install it through homebrew:
```
brew install python
```

# How to run

In your terminal, navigate to this folder. Then run run.py with this command:
```
python3 run.py
```

# How to experiment with this repo
Feel free to edit the test_numbers.txt file to test different number combinations. Running the run.py script will both print the result in your terminal and paste it into the results.txt file

If you want a big set of random numbers, look in the storage folder for random_numbers.txt
